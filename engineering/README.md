# Engineering Plugin

A software engineering plugin primarily designed for [Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), Anthropic's agentic desktop application — though it also works in Claude Code. Helps with standups, code review, architecture decisions, incident response, debugging, and technical documentation. Works with any engineering team — standalone with your input, supercharged when you connect your source control, project tracker, and monitoring tools.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/engineering
```

## Commands

Explicit workflows you invoke with a slash command:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/standup` | Generate a standup update from your recent activity — commits, PRs, tickets, and chat |
| `/review` | Review code changes — security, performance, style, and correctness |
| `/debug` | Structured debugging session — reproduce, isolate, diagnose, and fix |
| `/architecture` | Create or evaluate architecture decisions — ADR format with trade-off analysis |
| `/incident` | Run an incident response workflow — triage, communicate, mitigate, and write postmortem |
| `/deploy-checklist` | Pre-deployment checklist — verify tests, review changes, check dependencies, confirm rollback plan |

All commands work **standalone** (paste code, describe your system, upload files) and get **supercharged** with MCP connectors.

## Skills

Domain knowledge Claude uses automatically when relevant:

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `code-review` | Review code for bugs, security issues, performance, and maintainability |
| `incident-response` | Triage and manage production incidents — status updates, runbooks, postmortems |
| `system-design` | Design systems and services — architecture diagrams, API design, data modeling |
| `tech-debt` | Identify, categorize, and prioritize technical debt — build a remediation plan |
| `testing-strategy` | Design test strategies — unit, integration, e2e coverage, test plan creation |
| `documentation` | Write and maintain technical documentation — READMEs, API docs, runbooks, onboarding guides |
| `agent-runtime-boundaries` | Harden the runtime a coding agent executes inside — filesystem containment, credential scrubbing, egress allow-lists, process limits, tamper-evident audit, and the negative probes that prove each one |

## Example Workflows

### Morning Standup

```
/standup
```

If your tools are connected, I'll pull your recent commits, PR activity, and ticket updates. Otherwise, tell me what you worked on and I'll format it.

### Code Review

```
/review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123
```

Share a PR link, paste a diff, or point to files. Get a structured review covering security, performance, correctness, and style.

### Debugging an Issue

```
/debug Users are getting 500 errors on the checkout page
```

Walk through a structured debugging process: reproduce, isolate, diagnose, fix. I'll help you think through it systematically.

### Architecture Decision

```
/architecture Should we use a message queue or direct API calls between services?
```

Get a structured ADR with options analysis, trade-offs, and a recommendation.

### Incident Response

```
/incident The payments service is returning 503s
```

Start an incident workflow: triage severity, draft communications, track timeline, and generate a postmortem when resolved.

### Pre-Deploy Check

```
/deploy-checklist auth-service v2.3.0
```

Get a customized deployment checklist based on your service and what's changing.

### Hardening an Agent's Runtime

```
/agent-runtime-boundaries ~/work/payments-api
```

Find out what an autonomous agent can actually reach while it runs in that repo: which
credential files are in range, which variables survive into the child process, which hosts are
reachable, what the repo itself executes on clone/install/build, and what the audit trail can
and cannot prove. You get a boundary-by-boundary table, a recommended sandbox tier with the
honest statement of what that tier does *not* enforce, negative probes for each claim, the
approval gates that should be enforced outside the agent's reach, and the residual risk that
remains after the work.

## Standalone + Supercharged

Every command and skill works without any integrations:

| What You Can Do | Standalone | Supercharged With |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| Standup updates | Describe your work | Source control, Project tracker, Chat |
| Code review | Paste diff or code | Source control (pull PRs automatically) |
| Debug sessions | Describe the problem | Monitoring (pull logs and metrics) |
| Architecture decisions | Describe the system | Knowledge base (find prior ADRs) |
| Incident response | Describe the incident | Monitoring, Incident management, Chat |
| Deploy checklists | Describe the deploy | CI/CD, Source control |
| Agent runtime hardening | Name the repo and the asset you are worried about | Source control (read hooks, CI, devcontainer), Secrets manager |

## MCP Integrations

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md).

Connect your tools for a richer experience:

| Category | Examples | What It Enables |
|---|---|---|
| **Source control** | GitHub, GitLab | PR diffs, commit history, branch status |
| **Project tracker** | Linear, Jira, Asana | Ticket status, sprint data, assignments |
| **Monitoring** | Datadog, New Relic | Logs, metrics, alerts, dashboards |
| **Incident management** | PagerDuty, Opsgenie | On-call schedules, incident tracking, paging |
| **Chat** | Slack, Teams | Team discussions, standup channels |
| **Knowledge base** | Notion, Confluence | ADRs, runbooks, onboarding docs |

See [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) for the full list of supported integrations.

## Settings

Create a local settings file at `engineering/.claude/settings.local.json` to personalize:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Name",
  "title": "Software Engineer",
  "team": "Your Team",
  "company": "Your Company",
  "techStack": ["Python", "TypeScript", "PostgreSQL", "AWS"],
  "defaultBranch": "main",
  "deployProcess": "canary"
}
```

The plugin will ask you for this information interactively if it's not configured.
